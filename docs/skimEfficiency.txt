The analysisStep supy.steps.other.skimmer will write the events that
it processes to a .root file, in the format of the original TTree.
The function supy.utils.io.printSkimResults() will print the lines
that one might use to define a sample based on the skim.  The xs of
the skim is computed by this function as follows.  Consider a ``full''
sample:

- in which event weights compensate for (a) modified branching
  fractions during the generation; and also (b) a LO --> NLO
  ``k-factor'';

- which contains 10 events with weight 1.0, and 1 event with weight 6.0.

Let xs_full^LO = 360pb.  Then the event yield at 1/pb will be 1/pb *
360pb * (16.0)/11, i.e. multiply by the sum of the weights in the full
sample divided by the number of events in the full sample.

Consider a skimmed subset containing 1 event with weight 1.0 and 1
event with weight 6.0.  We desire a value of xs_subset^LO such that
the event yield at 1/pb will be 1/pb * 360pb * (16.0/11) * (7.0/16.0),
i.e. the above yield times the fraction of the weight kept during the
skim.

Imagine one has looped over the skimmed subset.  The event yield at
1/pb will be 1/pb * xs_subset^LO * (7.0/2).  Combining this with the
equation in the above paragraph, we find that the desired xs_subset^LO
= (2/11) * 360pb, i.e. the fraction of skimmed events (ignoring
weights) times the LO cross section of the full sample.
